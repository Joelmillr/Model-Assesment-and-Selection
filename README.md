# Model-Assesment-and-Selection

# Overview
The data is stored in a csv file called footballer_data.csv. The data contain 52 columns, including some information about the player, their skills, and their overall measure as an effective footballer.
<br>Most features relate to the player's abilities in football related skills, such as passing, shooting, dribbling, etc. Some features are rated on a 1-5 scale (5 being the best), others are rated on 0-100 (100 being the best), and others still are categorical (e.g. work rate is coded as low, medium, or high).
The target variable (or ùë¶ variable, if you will) is overall. This is an overall measure of the footballer's skill and is rated from 0 to 100. The most amazingly skilled footballer would be rated 100, where as I would struggle to score more than a 20. The model(s) you build should use the other features to predict overall.
